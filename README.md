# RSCG_Julia
This solves the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and gap equations in the s-wave superconductor with the use of the Reduced-Shifted Conjugate-Gradient Method method. See, Y. Nagai, Y. Shinohara, Y. Futamura, and T. Sakurai,[arXiv:1607.03992v2 or DOI:10.7566/JPSJ.86.014708]. http://dx.doi.org/10.7566/JPSJ.86.014708  

This code is for understanding the methods. This code ISNOT the fastest code.
The code works with Julia 1.0.0.
The code can do parallel computations, which is experimental. 

The result in this code is equivalent to RSCG with Python code
